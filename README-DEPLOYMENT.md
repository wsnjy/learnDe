## ðŸš€ Deploying to Cloudflare Pages via GitHub Actions

This guide will help you deploy the German Learning Application to Cloudflare Pages using GitHub Actions.

### Prerequisites

2. **Cloudflare Account**: Sign up at [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)
3. **Cloudflare API Token**: Required for automated deployment

### Step 1: Set up Cloudflare API Token

1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)

4. Copy your API token (you'll need this for GitLab)

### Step 2: Get your Cloudflare Account ID

1. Go to your [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Select any domain (or the right sidebar if you don't have domains)
3. Copy your Account ID from the right sidebar

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Repository

1. **Create a new GitHub repository**
2. **Add the project files** to your GitHub repository
3. **Set up GitHub Secrets**:
